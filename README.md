BEDFramework
============

A collection of scripts to perform various analytical functions on BED file(s).
Such functions include enumeration of BED entry lengths, and analysis as-to its most proximal GTF feature.
Oftentimes, a BED file may have a corresponding vector (i.e. conservation scores) per BED entry. Scripts are available for 
appreciating such scenarios.
